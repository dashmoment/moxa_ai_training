# Moxa A.I. Training Program

This repository provides source code for guide reading course

it's constructed as following:

## tutorial/DNN

## tutorial/CNN

The tuorial is modified from https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials

The major tutorial file is [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/dashmoment/moxa_ai_training/blob/master/tutorial/02_CNN/tutorial.ipynb)

You may need install [ipython Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

In this turtorial, we will show composition of CIFAR10 dataset and some preprocess for input image at first.

Then, demostrate how to build up a CNN network and train it.

Finally, we will review the training results and some parameters attributes after training 



## tutorial/RNN
